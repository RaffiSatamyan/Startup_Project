### Startup Success/Failure Analysis Report
# 1. Introduction

This report investigates the factors influencing the success or failure of startup companies. I analyze a dataset containing information on 472 startups, including details about the startups themselves and their founders. By understanding the trends and relationships within this data, i aim to shed light on the reasons behind startup success and failure.

#2. Important frature Description

The provided dataset includes information on 472 startups. The data dictionary details the specific attributes included for each startup and founder. Some attributes that comes out is very usefull:

1. Survival through recession: Whether the company survived during crises is a key factor, because only that very small proportion of startups that were able to overcome recessions were able to take advantage of this opportunity to grow
2. Big Data Business: if this is a Big Data Business, then this already speaks about the scale and viability of the business, which makes its further failure unlikely
3. Consulting experience?: Consulting experience for businesses is valuable because it brings specialized knowledge and tackles problems with fresh, objective eyes.
4. Solutions offered: it is very important to provide solutions to problems, because only in such cases is growth possible
5. Number of Sales Support material: More Sales Support materials (case studies, demos) equip startup salespeople to close deals faster by personalizing pitches to customer needs.
6. Dificulty of Obtaining Work force:  A high difficulty of obtaining qualified workers can slow down a startup's growth by limiting its ability to build a strong team.
7. Team size all employees: A larger team size allows a startup to tackle more projects and grow faster, but also requires managing additional overhead.

# 3. Methodology

I employ a combination of data analysis techniques to understand the factors influencing startup success/failure. Here are methods i use:

3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
3.2 Statistical Analysis:
3.3 Machine Learning (Optional):

# 4. Conclusion

By analyzing the available data, i aim to gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to the success or failure of startup companies. These insights can be beneficial for aspiring entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers interested in fostering a thriving startup ecosystem.

# 5. Limitations

It's important to acknowledge the limitations of this analysis. The success/failure criteria and the available data might not capture all relevant factors. Additionally, the dataset size might not be sufficient for drawing definitive conclusions.

# 6. Future Work

Based on the findings of this report, future work could involve:

1. Gathering additional data on startup outcomes and influencing factors.
2. Refining the analysis by focusing on specific industries or startup types.
3. further work with the data for the purpose of important missing data and deleting/changing outlayers
4. Developing a more sophisticated predictive model for startup success.
